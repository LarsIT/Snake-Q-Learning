# Snake-Q-Learning
First reinforcement learning project using the popular game "Snake" as an environment.

With this project I want to try out Deep QLearning and want to apply my knowledge of stochastic optimization problems in an AI environment.

TODO for next session:
- game visuals
- introduction of reinforcement learning (refactoring to account for agents, ...)
